# sudo-rs

https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs
A safety oriented and memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust.

Debian

```bash
apt-get install sudo-rs
```

This will offer the functionality using the commands sudo-rs, visudo-rs. If you want to invoke sudo-rs via the usual commands sudo and visudo instead, prepend /usr/lib/cargo/bin to your current $PATH variable.

```bash
export PATH=:/usr/lib/cargo/bin:$PATH
```

Newer versions are on Github.
